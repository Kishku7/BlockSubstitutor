# Block Substitutor

Block Substitutor is a lightweight downgrade‑compatibility mod for Minecraft 1.20.1.  
It automatically replaces unsupported 1.21.x blocks with safe 1.20.1 equivalents during world and chunk load, preserving blockstates and block entity data wherever possible.

This mod is ideal for players and servers who want to use worlds generated in newer versions of Minecraft while staying on 1.20.1 for stability, modpack compatibility, or performance reasons.

Features:
- Automatic replacement of unsupported 1.21.x blocks
- Blockstate and NBT preservation
- Optional startup scan across all loaded chunks
- Configurable mappings and logging
- Mod Menu + Cloth Config support
- Safe for servers and modpacks
